# Sports Classifier App (trained using PyTorch)

# Important Note
* Pre-trained model used was EfficientNet_B0 (model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset) : https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch
* Custom model was trained using the smallest EfficientNet, model imported using torch image model (timm) : https://huggingface.co/timm
* Model Trained on 100 different sports, refer to classes.txt for the list of different sports 
* For the purpose of using Streamlit cloud, the smallest model is chosen for a faster inference speed, with less accuracy
* Accuracy of the model is **93%**
